# forrel - Exclusion Power GUI

## Installation

This package requires `forrel` (available on CRAN) plus some other packages to
display the user interface. Installing packages from GitHub requires the package
`devtools` which is available on CRAN and may be installed with

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once you have `devtools` you may install `forrelgui` by pasting the
following into an R interactive session:

``` r
install.packages("forrel")
devtools::install_github("knifecake/forrelgui")
```

## Exclusion power

To launch the exclusion power graphical user interface import the
`forrelgui` package and use the `epGUI()` function like this:

``` r
library("forrelgui")
epGUI()
```
